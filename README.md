Introducing to Quid Pro; the ultimate online game that blends strategy, luck, and skill! Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Quid Pro is designed to entertain and challenge players with its unique gameplay mechanics and increasing levels of difficulty.

Whether you're looking for a casual gaming experience or a more competitive challenge, Quid Pro has something to offer.

Unique Features of Quid Pro:
Quid Pro stands out in the crowded online gaming space due to its distinct and engaging features:

- Pattern Matching Functionality: Unlike many games that rely solely on reflexes, Quid Pro challenges players to recognize and match patterns. This cognitive aspect adds depth to the gameplay, making it not only entertaining but also mentally stimulating.

- Limited Number of Tries: Each level in Quid Pro comes with a set number of attempts, adding a layer of pressure and excitement. This limitation encourages players to think carefully about each move, increasing the strategic element of the game.

- Score-Tracking System: Our comprehensive score-tracking system allows players to monitor their progress and strive for improvement. The ability to see and compare scores enhances the competitive spirit of the game.

- Play Against the Computer: Quid Pro offers an advanced AI opponent, providing a challenging and unpredictable adversary. This feature ensures that players are always facing new and varied challenges, keeping the gameplay fresh and engaging.

Why Quid Pro is Unique:
- Quid Pro's uniqueness lies in its perfect blend of strategy, chance, and cognitive challenge. Many games focus on one or two aspects, but Quid Pro integrates multiple dimensions of gameplay, making it a comprehensive and engaging experience. The inclusion of pattern matching, strategic limitations on attempts, score tracking, and AI competition ensures that players are continually tested and entertained.

Join us in the world of Quid Pro and experience a game that is as intellectually rewarding as it is fun. See how far your skills can take you and enjoy the thrill of continuous challenge and achievement. May the odds be ever in your favor!

  <img src="#" alt="Product Screenshot" width="400" height="300">
  </a>
  **A screenshot or graphic representation of a Slack meeting with team members.**

- Vision 2: Responding to change over following a plan: Throughout the project, the team managed (
