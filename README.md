<h2 id="management-and-development">Project Management and Development Approach</h2>

This project was implemented using the Agile Manifesto methodology. Below are the ways this project adhered to the 4 core values and 12 core principles of the aforementioned method:

<strong>Four Values of the Agile Manifesto:</strong>

- Vision 1: Customer collaboration over contract negotiation: The Team held **16** Hurdles through Slack Platform, ensuring alignment with user needs and prioritizing features through user story mapping.

<p align="center"><strong>A screenshot of a one of the team's huddles through slack.</strong></p>
<img src="./assets/images/team-huddle.png" alt="Screenshot of the team's huddle" width="600" height="100%">
<br>
<br>

- Vision 2: Responding to change over following a plan: Throughout the project, the team managed
  [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/Diana-is-Coding/R-P-S)](https://github.com/Diana-is-Coding/R-P-S/issues) + [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/Diana-is-Coding/R-P-S)](https://github.com/Diana-is-Coding/R-P-S/issues) GitHub issues, adapting to changing requirements and feedback iteratively.

- Vision 3: Working software over comprehensive documentation: We achieved **16 story points** across **1 sprint**, emphasizing the focus on delivering functional software increments.
